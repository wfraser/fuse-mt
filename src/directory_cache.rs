/// The way FUSE does readdir() is it gives you a buffer and an offset and asks you to fill the
/// buffer. If you have more entries than fit in the buffer, FUSE will call you again with a higher
/// offset, until you return an empty buffer.
///
/// Implementing this in the filesystem is tedious and a little tricky, so instead fuse-mt has the
/// filesystem just return a Vec with *all* the directory entries, and it takes care of paginating
/// it for FUSE.
///
/// To do this, we need to cache the response from the filesystem, and we need to give FUSE our own
/// file handle (the cache entry key) instead of the one the filesystem returned from opendir(), so
/// we have to store that file handle as well.
